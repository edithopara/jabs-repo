    <h3>Origin of Jollof Rice and Chicken</h3>
    <p>The Origin of jollof rice can be traced to the 1300s in the ancient Jolof empire, which spanned parts of today's senegal,<br>the Gambia and Mauritania. Rice farming flourished in this region and jollof began life as a dish called <em>thieboudienne,</em><br>prepared with rice, fish shellfish and vegetables. As the empire grew, the Jolof people dispersed accross the region and<br>settled in different parts of West Africa, taking their sumptuous rice dish with them. Despite the ubiquity accross the<br>region, few foods have caused as much of a stir as jollof rice. Today, every West African country has at least one variation<br>of jollof, which both divides and unites the region. Each nation and family add their own twist and interpretation, which<br>perhaps is the root of the fierce competition taking place across social media, parties and street side charts.</p>
